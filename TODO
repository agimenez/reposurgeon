* Figure out what the right behavior for the agito.svn test case is and
  implement it.

* Better behavior when svn_nobranch is off and there's no trunk -
  right now writing that out to a git repository then .git/HEAD
  will have "refs/heads/(null)" in it, which annoys quite a lot of git
  tools.

* In branchify.chk, looks like there is an extra file creation.
