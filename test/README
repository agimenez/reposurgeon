= Notes on the test machinery = 

A .fi extension means it's a git fast-import stream.  
An .sd extension means it's a Subversion repo dump.
A .chk extension means it's expected output from a test
A .tst extension means it's a test driver script

roundup-authors.txt is the auxiliary file used to test author mapping

== The Subversion extractor tests ==

Keeping live Subverson repos under version control doesn't work very well; 
in particular, things like the entries file change too often.  So what we 
do is keep Subversion dump files and rebuild the repo before each test.

=== Making new Subversion test loads ===

1. To create a new Subversion test repo, 'make svn-flat' or 'make svn-branchy'.

2. To copy trunk, creating a tag named 'foo'

   svn copy file://${PWD}/test-repo/trunk file://${PWD}/test-repo/tags/foo

3. sd-to-fi -d will dump the new test load to stdout.

=== The Subversion test loads ===

==== vanilla.sd ====

Standard layout. Linear. The simplest case, no tags or branches.

==== simpletag.sd ====

Standard layout. Linear. A couple of tags and no branches.

==== samplebranch.sd ====

Two-branch history with interleaved commits.

==== ignores.sd ====

Nonstandard layout - no branches, just stuff at top level.  Mainly
this is a test of the code for turning ignore properties into
.gitignore files.

==== nontipcopy.sd ====

Standard layout. Two branches, with the branch  creation right after the
copy.

==== rootfile.sd ====

Branchy layout with a file at the root level.
