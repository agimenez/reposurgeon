= Notes on the test machinery = 

== Making new Subversion test loads ==

1. To create a new Subversion test repo, 'make svn-flat' or 'make svn-branchy'.

2. To copy trunk, creating a tag named 'foo'

   svn copy file://${PWD}/test-repo/trunk file://${PWD}/test-repo/tags/foo

3. sd-to-fi -d will dump the new test load to stdout.

== The test loads ==

A .fi extension means it's a git fast-import stream.  
An .sd extension means it's a Subversion repo dump.

=== bs.fi ===

Git import stream for a multibranch repo with tags.

=== vanilla.sd ===

Standard layout. Linear. The simplest case, no tags or branches.

=== simpletag.sd ===

Standard layout. Linear. A couple of tags and no branches.

=== samplebranch.sd ===

Two-branch history with interleaved commits.

=== ignores.sd ===

Nonstandard layout - no branches, just stuff at top level.  Mainly
this is a test of the code for turning ignore properties into
.gitignore files.

=== nontipcopy.sd ===

Standard layout. Two branches, with the branch  creation right after the
copy.

=== rootfile.sd ===

Branchy layout with a file at the root level.
