# sd-to-fi - Subversion dump on stdin to fast-import on stout
#
# Relies on repostreamer bein where BIN declares it.
#
# With the -n option, create a repo corresponding to the input file
# and check out a working copy for editing, but do not stream the
# result to stdout and do not delete the repo.
#
# With the -r option, expect the repo to exist, pick it
# up with repostreamer, and throw the result to stdout; then
# do not delete the repo.
#
# With the -d option, expect the repo to exist, undump the repo to
# an sd file; then do not delete the repo.
#
# The -v option argument will be used to set reposurgeon's verbose option.
#
# To add complexity to a test load, do -n, then edit the test repo with
# Subversion, then use -d. Note: you must commit to force the repo to
# be up to date before streaming it.
