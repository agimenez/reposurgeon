This is a severely hacked and stripped-down extraction from the NUT repository 
intended to trap its major pathologies where they can be put under a 
microscope and used as a regression test.  It includes a multibranch commit,
a symlink, and a mid-branch delete followed by a branch rename to on top
of the deleted branch.  The original file content has been replaced with small
unique cookies, but the structure left intact.
