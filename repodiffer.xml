<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>This tool reports differences between two repository histories.
The histories may be presented as git repository directories or
as fast-import streams, or as one of each.</para>

<para>Revisions are compared in commit order; each is represented by a
SHA1 hash of the tree content and its metadata (committer name/date,
author name/date).  An algorithm resembling that of 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>diff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
is used to identify spans of identical commits and pick out changes, 
insertions, and deletions.</para>

<para>For each changed, inserted, or deleted revision, one line is
normally emitted identifying it by commit ID (for a repo) or mark (for
a stream file) in the first history.  In change reports, the corresponding
revision in the second history is similarly identified and the report
indicates the nature of the changes.</para>

<para>A trailing statistics line summarizes the operation counts.</para>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPTIONS</title>

<para>The --showequal or -e option enables listing of equal commits.</para>

<para>The --single or -s option compares single commits in detail.  The
argument must be a pair of commit IDs (marks or hashes) separated by an
equals sign.</para>

<para>The --ignore or -i option causes differences between specified
parts to be ignored.  Part tags are <quote>author</quote>,
<quote>authordate</quote>, <quote>committer</quote>,
<quote>commitdate</quote>, <quote>comment</quote>, <quote>timezone</quote>, and
<quote>tree</quote>; one, or a comma-separated list, can be
specified.</para>

<para>The --fullhash or -f option forces reporting of full 40-digit
hash IDs, rather than the normal short hash.</para>

<para>The --verbose or -v option enables debugging messages that are
probably only of interest to developers; consult the source code for
details.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='bugs'><title>BUGS</title>

<para>Parent pointers are not yet compared, so on multibranched repos
differences in DAG structure will not appear in the report.</para>

<para>Tags are not yet compared.</para>

<para>The above deficiencies are likely to be fixed in a future release.</para>

<para>When a blob changes, it causes tree differences to be reported in all
subsequent revisions containing the blob, rather than only the first commit
in which it occurs.  This probably will not be fixed; while it would be
theoretically possible, the computational cost of the comparison would 
become quite high.</para>
