			rs - a repository surgeon

eposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata,
(b) excising commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files
and subtrees from repo history. The original motivation for
reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts created by repository
conversions.

Acknowledgment: The Blue Sturgeon of Doom used on the reposurgeon
website and carried in this directory was GIMPed from the logo applied
to the the Hudson River Estuary by the Bew York State Department of
Environmental Conservation. Our adaptation of it is strictly nonprofit
and whimsical, so don't hurt us please.
