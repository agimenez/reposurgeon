			reposurgeon - a repository surgeon

reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata,
(b) excising commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files
and subtrees from repo history. The original motivation for
reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts created by repository
conversions.

reposurgeon can also read Subversion dump files directly, making it
useful for scripting very high-quality conversions from Subversion.
It is better than git-svn at tag lifting, automatically cleaning up 
cvs2svn conversion artifacts, dealing with nonstandard repository
layout, recognizing branch merges, and generally at handling 
Subversion's many odd corner cases.

An auxiliary script, svnpull, assists in mirroring Subversion
repositories. This distribution also includes a generic Makefile
describing a repeatable conversion workflow using these tools.

To test the correctness of this software, ensure that pylint
is installed and then type 'make check'

reposurgeon is a large, algorithmically extremely complex program.  It
may still have bugs when dealing with strange corner cases in older
repositories.  It is often extremely difficult or impossible to
reproduce those bugs without a full copy of the history on which they
occurred.

When you find a bug, please send me

(a) An exact description of how observed behavior differed from expected
behavior.

(b) A git fast-import or Subversion dump file of the repository you
were operating on.

(c) The sequence of reposurgeon commands that tickled the bug.
