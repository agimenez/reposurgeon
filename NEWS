			reposurgeon project news

0.5:
     We can round-trip bzr dumps with commit properties.
     New 'split' operation, opposite of coalesce.
     Multiple author headers per commit are handled (helps with bzr).
     So are branch-nick commit attributes (also helps with bzr). 

0.4: 2010-11-08:
     Handling of inline data, previously extremely buggy, has been fixed.
     Can now handle streams produced by bzr-fast-export, which uses inline.
     Unfortunately, bzr-fast-import is buggy enough to make rebuilds fail.
     First cut at hg support, by Phil Roberts.

0.3: 2010-11-07
     'split' operation renamed to 'cut'.
     New 'inspect' command for looking at commits in raw form.
     'list' command adapts to current width of terminal window.
     Issue a baton prompt during repo cleanup, which can be a long process.
     Multiple instances can now run in the same directory.
     Some speedup on import and export.

0.2: 2010-11-04
     Filenames with embedded whitespace are handled. 
     The 'expunge' operation to remove files from the history is working.
     The 'split' operation (topological cut) is now working.
     There is a new 'drop' command to drop repositories from the load list.
     There is a new 'history' command to display your session history.
     The 'view' command was a bad idea and has been removed.
     & followed by branch name resolves to everything on the branch.
     A bug that caused spurious date modifications when editing events
     with a non-local timezone has been fixed.
