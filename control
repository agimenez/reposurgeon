Package: reposurgeon

Description: a tool for editing version-control repository history
 reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't want 
 to let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata and removing
 commits.  It works with any version control system that can export and 
 import git fast-import streams, including git and hg and bzr.
