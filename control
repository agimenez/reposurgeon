Package: reposurgeon

Description: A tool for editing version-control repository history.
 reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't want 
 to let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata and removing
 commits.  It works with any version control system that can export and 
 import git fast-import streams, including git, hg, fossil, bzr, CVS, and RCS. 
 It can also read Subversion dump files directly and can thus be used to script
 production of very high-quality conversions from Subversion to any 
 supported DVCS.
